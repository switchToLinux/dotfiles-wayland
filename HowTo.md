## how to use cliplist

Listen for clipboard changes
`$ wl-paste --watch cliphist store`
This will listen for changes on your primary clipboard and write them to the history.
Call it once per session - for example, in your Sway config.

Select an old item
`$ cliphist list | dmenu | cliphist decode | wl-copy`
Bind it to something nice on your keyboard.

Delete an old item
`$ cliphist list | dmenu | cliphist delete`
Or else query manually: `$ cliphist delete-query "secret item"`.

Clear database
`$ cliphist wipe.`
